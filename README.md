## 🐱 Introduction 🐱

ClowderTask is a work-in-progress desktop application where you earn points to pamper a virtual cat by completing your tasks! The idea is that it'll work by attaching software to your tasks so you can then keep track of how long you've spent on a task. The more time you spend doing things you should do, the more points you earn for your virtual cat!
